         <p class="divP">
           The world setting of Elden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a made-up continent governed by a number of demigods. The immortal Queen Marika, who served as the guardian of the Elden Ring, a powerful force that took the form of the physical notion of order, had previously been in charge of it. Following Marika's eventual destruction of the Elden Ring and disappearance, a conflict known as the Shattering erupted between her demigod children for fragments of the Ring. Each demigod carries a Great Rune, a piece of the Ring that has the power to corrupt them. In the game, the player character is a Tarnished, one of a group of exiles from the Lands Between who are summoned back after the Shattering.
