           Ghost of Tsushima is an action-adventure game created by Sucker Punch Productions and released by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2020. The game is played from a third-person prespective. To complete the stated objectives, the player can choose from a range of gaming alternatives. They are able to use their katana to fight adversaries head-on or players can use stealth which enables them to avoid foes and discreetly attack them. Many companies rate the game 7-9 out of 10, we personally rate it a 9/10. The game tells a fascinating story while delivering top-tier gameplay mechanics, it features a large open world which can be explored with or without guidance based on wind direction and it has many side quests and  NPCs with whom the player can interact.

         <p class="divP">
          Although Ghost of Tsushima is a made-up story with made-up characters, it is based on the Mongol Empire's very real 1274 invasion of Japan, which started on the Island of Tsushima. You take control of Jin Sakai, played skillfully by Daisuke Tsuji of The Man in the High Castle, who begins as a samurai before learning after a disastrous battle against the invaders that perhaps the honorable but constrictive ways of the samurai code might not be enough to deal with this new and existential threat. While it takes a little while to really get rolling, Ghost of Tsushima centers on this internal fight between Jin's earliest lessons and his desire to protect his hometown at any costs. Jin may not be the most endearing of heroes, but Patrick Gallagher, who plays Khotun Khan, Thanks to his mellow intensity that is curiously comforting despite his terrifying aims, he is one of the most enduring video game antagonists in recent memory. He is very crafty and constantly one step ahead, and his role as the villain has a significant role in how well Jin's 40 to 50-hour quest for vengeance goes.
